All the assignments for the course CS 5010 Program Design Paradigm in Java 8
The course provides an intensive tour of programming and design. The main objective of the course is expose students to different ways of thinking of a problem and designing robust solutions using a mix of program design paradigms. We will discuss and compare object-oriented and functional design paradigms. We will concentrate on object-oriented program design and the design of abstractions that support the design of reusable software and libraries.

The course reviews typical object-oriented concepts such as information hiding, encapsulation and various forms of polymorphism. It contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse. It provides a deeper understanding of object-oriented design using the use of graphical design notations such as UML and object-oriented design patterns. Finally it emphasizes on testing, specifically unit testing of components.

An important aspect of this course is to write clean, well-structured, well-documented code. Students will be expected to design and program to facilitate reuse, minimize code duplication and make it “future-proof”. Students will also be expected to explain and defend their design and programming decisions to code panels. In this sense this course trains students to see programming as a “people’s discipline”.
